- Input validation and sanitization
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Securely storing and transmitting data
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms

**9. Testing and Debugging:**

- Unit testing with frameworks like Jest or Mocha
- End-to-end testing with tools like Cypress or Puppeteer
- Debugging techniques and tools (e.g., browser developer tools)
- Test-driven development (TDD) and behavior-driven development (BDD)
- Performance profiling and memory management

**10. Build Tools and Automation:**

- Task runners like Gulp or Grunt
